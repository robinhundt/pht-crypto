# Partially Homomorphic Threshold Cryptography
This library implements partially homomorphic threshold encryption. Currently, only a  threshold variant of paillier is implemented.

## WARNING!
This library is written as a learning exercise and for research purposes. Do **not** use for anything that should be secure.


## Todo
- [ ] implement ergonomic Api on ciphertexts with implicit public key
- [ ] better documentation
- [ ] set up CI pipeline
- [ ] misuse resistant `share_combine` function
- [ ] proper error handling (use `thiserror`)
- [ ] make serde dependency optional
